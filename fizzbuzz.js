/* Totally Not Another FizzBuzz 

Your CEO wants you to write a program to grant special bonuses to all his employees based on their employee ID numbers! 

If the employee's ID number is: 

Divisible by 3 - Vacation! 
Divisible by 5 - $100,000 bonus! 
Divisible by both 3 and 5 - JACKPOT! 1 Million and a Yacht!
Not divisible by 3 or 5 - :(
    
Write a program that will receive an employee's ID number as input 
and print their prize.
