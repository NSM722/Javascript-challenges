# Random Javascript challenges

### How I solve the challenges :
 - Writing pseudocode
 - When In doubt I checkout my notes or look up some topics on the internet
 - Using console.log() statements to help in debugging & keep track of the outputs at every stage
 ```javascript
 example: console.log('Loop is running')
 ```
 - Using built in methods unless stated otherwise 
 - Practice solving the problems aloud (Rubber Duck debugging)
 - When stuck past the set time limit - Study solutions and try again
 - Keep it DRY however readable
